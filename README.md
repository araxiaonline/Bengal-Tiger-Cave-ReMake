## What This SQL Does
- Removes "Tiger Riding" skill requirement from 3 of the 4 mounts, changing it to current Riding skill
- Makes the mounts Bind on Pickup (instead of Bind on Use to prevent AH flooding)
- Converts the World Mount Vendor NPC into an actual vendor
- Adds all 4 mounts to the World Mount Vendor's vendor list
- Spawns the vendor in the Bengal Tiger Cave
- Creates a `.tele` command to the Bengal Tiger Cave

## AzerothCore Version
This version has been updated and adapted for **AzerothCore** emulator.
